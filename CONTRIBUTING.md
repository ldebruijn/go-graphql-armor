# Contributing

Awesome that you're looking to contribute!
Before going nose-deep into the code, please first discuss the change you wish to make via an issue.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md or the docs with any changes to the public interfaces, including configuration changes, functional changes or anything else that may affect users.
3. Once you've gotten a sign-off of one of the maintainers, you can merge your Pull Request.
