# Go GraphQL Armor üõ°Ô∏è

This is repository inspired by the great work of the [original JS GraphQL Armor](https://github.com/Escape-Technologies/graphql-armor) middleware.
It is dead-simple yet highly customizable security sidecar compatible with any HTTP GraphQL Server or Gateway.

## Configuration

We recommend configuring the binary using a yaml file, place a file called `armor.yml` in the same directory as you're running the binary.

For all the configuration options check out the [Configuration Documentation](docs/configuration.md)

```yaml
web:
  read_timeout: 5s
  write_timeout: 10s
  idle_timeout: 120s
  shutdown_timeout: 20s
  host: 0.0.0.0:8080
  path: /graphql

target:
  host: http://localhost:8081
  timeout: 10s
  keep_alive: 180s

persisted_operations:
  enabled: true
  fail_unknown_operations: true
  store:
    # Only one store will be used
    # Armor will look at all files in the dir and try to load persisted operations from any `.json` file
    dir: "./my-dir"
    # Armor will look at all objects in the bucket and try to load persisted operations from any `.json` file
    gcp_bucket: "gs://somebucket"

field_suggestions:
  enabled: true
```

Alternatively go-graphql-armor can be configured using environment variables or command line arguments.
